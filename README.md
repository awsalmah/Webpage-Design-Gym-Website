# Webpage-Design-Gym-Website

## About

This project aims to create a responsive and interactive multipage website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript/JQuery and PHP.

The frontend has been designed using HTML/CSS and JavaScript. As for styling, only external style sheets have been used(no inline styling). JavaScript/JQuery were also used to dynamically create content, change styles, as well as to validate input and/or perform calculations on user input.

For the backend, MySQL database was used to store data permanently. PHP was used to retrieve, edit, and store data.
